            The Dunning窶適ruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people with limited competence in a
            particular domain overestimate their abilities.<br>
            It was first described by Justin Kruger and David Dunning in 1999.
            Some researchers also include the opposite effect for high performers: their tendency to underestimate their
            skills.
            In popular culture, the Dunning窶適ruger effect is often misunderstood as a claim about general
            overconfidence of people with low intelligence instead of specific overconfidence of people unskilled
            at a particular task.

        <h3>
            some points on the practical signficance of the Effect:
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Assessing the objective competence of indiviuals in sensitive fields</li>
            <li>an individual could better asess thier own personal strengths and weakness' by the Effect</li>
            <li>having an indicatior for curbing overconfidence and overestimation in newbees in a field or discipline
            </li>

        <p id="conclusion">The Dunning-Kruger effect phenomenon isn't limited to labs and studies.
            You can see it--and its
            consequences--almost everywhere in the real world.
            This includes:
            Work
            At work, everyone can be prone to overestimating their ability to perform well at their job. But showing too
            much overconfidence without the necessary evidence to back it up could make it hard to manage expectations
            among your co-workers and managers.
            The Dunning-Kruger effect can affect many parts of the work environment.

            This includes:

            Recruiting candidates who seem confident but, in reality, are unqualified for the position
            Tension and conflict that create a toxic environment
            To combat this, managers often hold yearly and semiannual performance reviews to give employees feedback on
            their work ethic and the quality of their work.
